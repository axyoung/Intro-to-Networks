the main will send data to rdt_layer to process in iterations
in each iteration it calls process data 4 times
once for client channel, once for the client to server channel, once for the server channel, and once for the server to client channel

when processData is called it will call processSend and processReceiveAndSendRespond

processSend will manage the segment sending tasks in a flow window of 15 at a time with data length of 4. this is where i need to create data segments to send, set the seqnum

someone mentioned moving segmentSend=segment() inside a while loop

processRecieve will read in the ack and making new acks and stuffz

will call the send and recieve to pass data and read data that the unreliable channel passes

the recieve will take in a list of segments and we need to send a packet/segment
